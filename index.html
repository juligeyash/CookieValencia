          <h2>Quick reminder about me</h2>
          <p>
            G'day, mates! I'm Cookie, a small and stunning feline with the most
            expressive green eyes you'll ever see. <br />
            <br />
            Born and raised in Melbourne-Australia, I'm a proud 16-year-old Gen
            X cat. <br />
            <br />
            My human parents absolutely adore me, and why wouldn't they? I'm a
            multilingual marvel, fluent in Cat, English, and Spanish. <br />
            <br />
            I love soaking up the sun, snoozing, and finding the perfect hiding
            spots. I'm always up for trying a bit of human food and have a
            peculiar fondness for munching on cables. <br />
            While I'm quite social, it's always on my own terms. I'm a very
            chatty, tender, caring, and smart kitty.<br /><br />
            However, not everything is rosy, I have my dislikes too, for
            example, ‚Äì technology isn't my cup of tea. <br /><br />
            I can't stand the vacuum cleaner or the water fountain. All in all,
            I'm a delightful mix of charm and sass, and I wouldn't have it any
            other way. Cheers!

          <h2>The opportunity</h2>
          <p>
            My human parents recently got an exciting opportunity to move to the
            USA, and let me tell you, they were over the moon about it! However,
            they were also quite worried about my trip, but they never once
            thought about leaving me behind.
          </p>
          Instead, they did their homework and researched the best possible way
          to bring me along safely. Thanks to their dedication, I'll be joining
          them on this new adventure across the pond.

          <h2>Preping for the trip</h2>
          <p>
            Continuing my tale, my mum really went above and beyond to prepare
            me for our big move across the ocean. She got me a super comfy
            travelling suit and took me around Melbourne with her whenever she
            ran errands. It was quite the adventure! She made sure to explain
            multiple times what was going to happen and reminded me to be brave
            and strong. For a bit, she even gave me some CBD to help with the
            plane ride, but oh boy, that stuff made me feel all kinds of crazy.
            In the end, she packed me a lunch box with my favourite treats, a
            sock stuffed with catnip to help me relax, one of her oldest jumpers
            for comfort, and, of course, Queenton my trusty teddy bear. Thanks
            to all her efforts, I felt as prepared as any adventurous kitty
            could be for the journey ahead. Cheers to my amazing mum! üêæ‚úàÔ∏è
