            <strong>Quick reminder about me</strong><br><br>
            G'day, mates! I'm Cookie Valencia, a small and stunning feline with the most
            expressive green eyes you'll ever see. <br />
            <br />
            Born and raised in Melbourne-Australia, I'm a proud 16-year-old Gen
            X cat. <br />
            <br />
            My parents absolutely adore me, and why wouldn't they? I'm a
            multilingual marvel, fluent in Cat, English, and Spanish. <br />
            <br />
            I love soaking up the sun, snoozing, and finding the perfect hiding
            spots. I'm a foodie, always up for trying a bit of human food and have a
            peculiar fondness for munching on cables. <br /> <br />
            While I'm quite social, it's always on my own terms. I'm a very
            chatty, tender, caring, and smart kitty.<br /><br />
            Technology isn't my cup of tea. I can't stand the vacuum cleaner or the water fountain. <br> <br>
            All in all,
            I'm a delightful mix of charm and sass, and I wouldn't have it any
            other way. Cheers!
          </p>

            <strong>The opportunity</strong><br> <br>
            My parents recently got an exciting opportunity to move to the
            USA, and let me tell you, they were over the moon about it! <br /><br />However,
            they were also quite worried about my trip, but they never once
            thought about leaving me behind. How could they, I am their very special furry daughter! üêæ  <br> <br>
          Instead, they did their homework and found the best possible way
          to bring me along safely. Thanks to their dedication, I am joining
          them on this new adventure across the pond. <br><br>
          <a href="https://www.jetpets.com.au/" target="_blank">Jetpets</a> is the company they trusted me to bring me across the ocean. I strongly recommend this company, they did a great job!

            <strong>Preping for the trip</strong><br><br>
            Continuing my tale, my mum really went above and beyond to prepare
            me for our big move across the ocean. She got me a super comfy
            travelling cabin and took me around Melbourne in it with her whenever she
            ran errands so that I could make it my own and get used to a bit of randomness. It was quite the adventure! <br> <br>
            Oh boy my mum can talk, sometimes she is like a broken radio! She explained a million times
            that I was going to have a big trip, get on a plane for many hours bymyself and what was going to happen in the process. She emphisised that I needed to brave. <br> <br>
            In the weeks prior to my trip, she even gave me some CBD to test wether that oil could help me relax in the plane, but that stuff was yuk and made me feel all kinds of crazy! <br> <br>
            In the end, she packed me a lunch box with my favourite treats and food, a
            and in my portable luxirious cabin she put an old sock stuffed with catnip to help me relax, one of her oldest jumpers
            for comfort, and, of course, Queenton my trusty teddy bear. <br> <br>
            Thanks
            to all her efforts, I felt as prepared as any adventurous kitty
            could be for the journey ahead. Cheers to my amazing mum! üêæ‚úàÔ∏è

          <Strong>My trip</strong><br><br>
        Let me tell you about my flying adventure. The day before my flight, a driver picked me up and whisked me away to a lovely hotel for pets where they treated me like royalty. The next day, I had an early breakky, did my business, took a nap, and had a little wander around.<br><br>

       Two hours before my flight, I strolled into the Qantas pet international lounge. Everything went smoothly, and I boarded the plane on time, ready for the adventure ahead. My cabin was temperature-controlled and dimmed, giving it an exclusive feel with no other pets around me. Talk about luxury! <br><br>

       After a relaxing layover in LA to stretch my legs, I boarded a late afternoon flight to Chicago.

        <div class="reunion">
          <p>
          <strong>My Arrival</strong><br> <br>
        Finally, the moment came when I was reunited with my human parents, and they were absolutely over the moon. It felt like they could finally breathe again after holding their breath for 48 hours. I have no idea why they were so stressed out. <br> <br>

I did feel a bit weird, though‚Äîtired and confused because it should've been night time in Australia. I guess that's what my parents call jet lag. Despite that, being back with my family was the best feeling ever.
