            <strong>Quick reminder about me</strong><br><br>
            G'day, mates! I'm Cookie Valencia, a small and stunning feline with the most
            expressive green eyes you'll ever see. <br />
            <br />
            Born and raised in Melbourne-Australia, I'm a proud 16-year-old Gen
            X cat. <br />
            <br />
            My parents absolutely adore me, and why wouldn't they? I'm a
            multilingual marvel, fluent in Cat, English, and Spanish. <br />
            <br />
            I love soaking up the sun, snoozing, and finding the perfect hiding
            spots. I'm a foodie, always up for trying a bit of human food and have a
            peculiar fondness for munching on cables. <br />
            While I'm quite social, it's always on my own terms. I'm a very
            chatty, tender, caring, and smart kitty.<br /><br />
            Technology isn't my cup of tea. I can't stand the vacuum cleaner or the water fountain. <br> <br>
            All in all,
            I'm a delightful mix of charm and sass, and I wouldn't have it any
            other way. Cheers!
          </p>

            <strong>The opportunity</strong><br> <br>
            My parents recently got an exciting opportunity to move to the
            USA, and let me tell you, they were over the moon about it! However,
            they were also quite worried about my trip, but they never once
            thought about leaving me behind. <br>
          Instead, they did their homework and found the best possible way
          to bring me along safely. Thanks to their dedication, I am joining
          them on this new adventure across the pond. 
          </p>

            <strong>Preping for the trip</strong><br><br>
            Continuing my tale, my mum really went above and beyond to prepare
            me for our big move across the ocean. She got me a super comfy
            travelling cabin and took me around Melbourne in it with her whenever she
            ran errands so that I could make it my own and get used to a bit of randomness. It was quite the adventure! <br> <br>
            Oh boy my mum can talk, sometimes she is like a broken radio! She explained a million times
            that I was going to have a big trip, and what was going to happen. She emphisesed that I needed to brave. <br> <br>
            In the weeks prior to my trip, she even gave me some CBD to test wether that could help me relax in the plane, but oh boy, that stuff made me feel all kinds of crazy. <br> <br>
            In the end, she packed me a lunch box with my favourite treats and food, a
            sock stuffed with catnip to help me relax, one of her oldest jumpers
            for comfort, and, of course, Queenton my trusty teddy bear. <br> <br>
            Thanks
            to all her efforts, I felt as prepared as any adventurous kitty
            could be for the journey ahead. Cheers to my amazing mum! üêæ‚úàÔ∏è
